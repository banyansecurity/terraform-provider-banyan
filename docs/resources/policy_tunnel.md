# banyan_policy_tunnel (Resource)

The tunnel policy resource is used to manage the lifecycle of policies which will be attached to services of the type `banyan_service_tunnel`. For more information on Banyan policies, see the [documentation.](https://docs.banyanops.com/docs/feature-guides/administer-security-policies/policies/manage-policies/)

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "banyan_policy_tunnel" "example" {
  name        = "corporate-network-users"
  description = "some tunnel policy description"
  access {
    roles       = ["Everyone"]
    trust_level = "High"
  }
}

## Example Usage with Layer 4 Access Policy

resource "banyan_policy_tunnel" "example" {
  name        = "corporate-network-users"
  description = "some tunnel policy description"
  access {
    roles       = ["Everyone"]
    trust_level = "High"
    l4_access {
      allow {
        cidrs     = ["10.10.10.0/24"]
        protocols = ["TCP"]
        ports     = ["443"]
      }
    }
  }
  access {
    roles       = ["Corporate"]
    trust_level = "Medium"
    l4_access {
      allow {
        cidrs     = ["10.10.10.0/24"]
        protocols = ["TCP"]
        ports     = ["443"]
        fqdns = ["www.allowthisfqdn.com"]
      }
      deny {
        cidrs = ["10.1.1.0/24"]
        protocols = ["UDP","ICMP"]
        ports = ["8081","8082"]
        fqdns = ["www.denythisfqdn.com"]
      }
    }
  }
}

resource "banyan_policy_tunnel" "anyone-high" {
  name        = "corporate-network-users"
  description = "${banyan_accesstier.example.name} allow users"
  access {
    roles       = ["Everyone"]
    trust_level = "High"
    l4_access {
      allow {
        cidrs     = ["10.10.10.0/24"]
        protocols = ["TCP"]
        ports     = ["443"]
      }
    }
  }
}

resource "banyan_policy_tunnel" "example" {
  name        = "example-policy"
  description = "Example policy description"
  access {
    roles       = ["role1", "role2"]
    trust_level = "Medium"
    l4_access {
      allow {
        cidrs     = ["10.0.0.0/24"]
        protocols = ["TCP", "UDP"]
        ports     = ["8080", "443","80"]
        fqdns     = ["example.com"]
      }
      deny {
        cidrs     = ["192.168.0.0/16"]
        protocols = ["TCP"]
        ports     = ["8443"]

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# For importing a resource we require resource Id, which can be obtained from console for the resource we are importing
# And we need to create an entry in .tf file which represents the resource which would be imported.
# for e.g adding an entry into main.tf
# main.tf:
# resource "banyan_policy_tunnel" "myexample" {
#   name = "myexample"
# }

terraform import banyan_policy_tunnel.myexample 46f3a708-2a9a-4c87-b18e-b11b6c92bf24

terraform show
# update thw show output configuration into above main.tf file, then resource is managed.
# BE CAUTIOUS before terraform apply, do terraform plan and verify there are no changes to be applied.

# Terraform Version 1.5.x or Later:
# We can create Import tf files
# for e.g
# import.tf:
# import {
#  to = banyan_policy_tunnel.myexample
#  id = "46f3a708-2a9a-4c87-b18e-b11b6c92bf24"
# }
#  Then execute
terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated.tf
# Configurations are imported into generated.tf edit and verify
# BE CAUTIOUS before terraform apply, do terraform plan and verify there are no changes to be applied.
```

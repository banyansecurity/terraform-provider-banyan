# banyan_service_tunnel (Resource)

Resource used for lifecycle management of service tunnels. In order to properly function this resource must be utilized with the banyan_accesstier resource or banyan_accesstier2 terraform registry modules. Please see the example below and in the terraform modules for the respective cloud provider. For more information on service tunnels see the documentation https://docs.banyansecurity.io/docs/feature-guides/service-tunnels/

## Example Usage
```terraform
resource "banyan_api_key" "example" {
  name        = "example api key"
  description = "example api key"
  scope       = "access_tier"
}

resource "banyan_accesstier" "example" {
  name         = "example"
  address      = "*.example.mycompany.com"
  api_key_id   = banyan_api_key.example.name
  tunnel_cidrs = ["10.10.1.0/24"]
}

resource "banyan_service_tunnel" "example" {
  name         = "example-anyone-high"
  description  = "tunnel allowing anyone with a high trust level"
  access_tiers = [banyan_accesstier.example.name]
  policy       = banyan_policy_tunnel.anyone-high.id
}

resource "banyan_policy_tunnel" "anyone-high" {
  name        = "allow anyone"
  description = "${banyan_accesstier.example.name} allow"
  access {
    roles       = ["ANY"]
    trust_level = "High"
  }
}
```

## Example Service Tunnel with L4 Policy
```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    banyan = {
      source  = "github.com/banyansecurity/banyan"
      version = ">=0.9.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "banyan" {
  api_key = "igKuZugo6yH3_ig04qE8mYEeqDcSi-5s_uQr9Td0zsI"
}

resource "banyan_api_key" "example" {
  name        = "example api key"
  description = "example api key"
  scope       = "access_tier"
}

resource "banyan_accesstier" "example" {
  name         = "example"
  address      = "*.example.mycompany.com"
  api_key_id   = banyan_api_key.example.name
  tunnel_cidrs = ["10.10.0.0/16"]
}

resource "banyan_service_tunnel" "users" {
  name         = "corporate network"
  description  = "tunnel allowing anyone with a high trust level access to 443"
  access_tiers = [banyan_accesstier.example.name]
  policy       = banyan_policy_tunnel.anyone-high.id
}

resource "banyan_service_tunnel" "administrators" {
  name         = "corporate network admin"
  description  = "tunnel allowing administrators access to the networks"
  access_tiers = [banyan_accesstier.example.name]
  policy       = banyan_policy_tunnel.administrators.id
}

resource "banyan_policy_tunnel" "anyone-high" {
  name        = "corporate-network-users"
  description = "${banyan_accesstier.example.name} allow users"
  access {
    roles       = ["Everyone"]
    trust_level = "High"
    l4_access {
      allow {
        cidrs     = ["10.10.10.0/24"]
        protocols = ["TCP"]
        ports     = ["443"]
      }
    }
  }
}

resource "banyan_policy_tunnel" "administrators" {
  name        = "corporate-network-admin"
  description = "${banyan_accesstier.example.name} allow only administrators access to the entire network"
  access {
    roles       = ["Everyone"]
    trust_level = "High"
    l4_access {
      allow {
        cidrs     = ["10.10.10.0/24"]
        protocols = ["TCP"]
        ports     = ["443"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
In this example an access tier is configured to tunnel `10.10.0.0/16`. A service tunnel is configured to utilize this access tier, and a policy is attached which only allows users with a `High` trust level access to services running on port 443 in the subnet `10.10.1.0/24`. An additional service tunnel and policy allows administrators access to the entire network behind the tunnel.

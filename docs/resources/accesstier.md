# banyan_accesstier (Resource)

The access tier resource allows for configuration of the access tier API object. We recommend utilizing the [banyan-accesstier2](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/banyansecurity/banyan-accesstier2) Terraform registry module specific to your cloud provider. For more information about the access tier see the [documentation](https://docs.banyansecurity.io/docs/banyan-components/accesstier/)

## Example Usage
```terraform
resource "banyan_api_key" "example" {
  name        = "example api key"
  description = "example api key"
  scope       = "access_tier"
}

resource "banyan_accesstier" "example" {
  name       = "example"
  address    = "*.example.mycompany.com"
  api_key_id = banyan_api_key.example.id
}
```

## Example Access Tier with Service Tunnel
```terraform
resource "banyan_api_key" "example" {
  name        = "example api key"
  description = "example api key"
  scope       = "access_tier"
}

resource "banyan_accesstier" "example" {
  name         = "example"
  address      = "*.example.mycompany.com"
  api_key_id   = banyan_api_key.example.name
  tunnel_cidrs = ["10.10.1.0/24"]
}

resource "banyan_service_tunnel" "example" {
  name         = "example-anyone-high"
  description  = "tunnel allowing anyone with a high trust level"
  access_tiers = [banyan_accesstier.example.name]
  policy       = banyan_policy_tunnel.anyone-high.id
}

resource "banyan_policy_tunnel" "anyone-high" {
  name        = "allow anyone"
  description = "${banyan_accesstier.example.name} allow"
  access {
    roles       = ["ANY"]
    trust_level = "High"
  }
}
```

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) ID of the access tier in Banyan
## Import
Import is supported using the following syntax:
```shell
# For importing a resource we require resource Id, which can be obtained from console for the resource we are importing
# And we need to create an entry in .tf file which represents the resource which would be imported.
# for e.g adding an entry into main.tf
# main.tf:
# resource "banyan_accesstier" "myexample" {
#   name = "myexample"
# }

terraform import banyan_accesstier.myexample 46f3a708-2a9a-4c87-b18e-b11b6c92bf24

terraform show

# or import via accesstier name
terraform import banyan_accesstier.myexample name:myexample

terraform show


# update thw show output configuration into above main.tf file, then resource is managed.
# BE CAUTIOUS before terraform apply, do terraform plan and verify there are no changes to be applied.

# Terraform Version 1.5.x or Later:
# We can create Import tf files
# for e.g
# import.tf:
# import {
#  to = banyan_accesstier.myexample
#  id = "46f3a708-2a9a-4c87-b18e-b11b6c92bf24"
# }
# or import via access_tier name
# import {
#  to = banyan_accesstier.myexample
#  id = "name:myexample"
# }
#  Then execute
terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated.tf
# Configurations are imported into generated.tf edit and verify
# BE CAUTIOUS before terraform apply, do terraform plan and verify there are no changes to be applied.

# Release Notes

For important information on this release please visit the [Release Notes](https://github.com/banyansecurity/terraform-provider-banyan/releases/tag/v1.1.0)

## Configuration with your Banyan API Key as an environment variable
The `api_key` parameter can be omitted from the provider configuration block by setting the `BANYAN_API_KEY` environment variable as your API key and implementing the provider as follows:
```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    banyan = {
      source  = "banyansecurity/banyan"
      version = "1.1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "banyan" {
}
```
This is the recommended method to authenticate the provider

## Configuration with your Banyan API Key as a parameter
```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    banyan = {
      source  = "banyansecurity/banyan"
      version = "1.1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "banyan" {
  api_key = "ADMIN_SCOPED_API_KEY"
}
```
This method should be used with caution as your API key should remain secret
